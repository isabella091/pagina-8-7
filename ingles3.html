    6 Simple principles to build peace in your community
    <br>
    <br>
If you switch on the TV news, open the newspaper or click onto a popular news website, there’s always news about a terrorist attack, war, ongoing conflict and a general lack of peace amongst different groups of people.
<br>
<br>
In an increasingly globalised world, we should understand each other better, stand ever more united and strive for peace. Sadly, the truth is quite the opposite.
<br>
<br>
There’s conflict in Israel/Palestine, Kashmir, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, all over the world in fact…
As individuals and citizens, how do we deal with this? How does this relate to us? How can we make positive changes to enable us to live in peace?

<div class="simple">

</div>
<br>

RULE #1: TREAT OTHERS THE WAY YOU WISH TO BE TREATED
The good old Golden Rule says it all: empathy, tolerance and peace. This principle teaches you to love yourself and love others.
<br>
<div class="sip">

</div>
<br>
<br>
It spans cultures and faiths and is a universal age old concept which can’t fail! 
<br>
<br>
RULE #2: LISTEN TO HEAR WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO SAY, NOT TO SPEAK
Engage in dialogue with an open mind and the real will to listen to others.
<br>
<div class="mono">

</div>
<br>
Only then will you be able to understand each other and build bridges.
<br>
<br>
Change cannot happen and peace cannot be established if people are unable to communicate with others;
<br>
<br>
to listen to their experiences and views and show empathy, understanding and compassion.
<br>
<br>


RULE #3: ACCEPT DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
We all have different opinions and we may not all agree on the same things.
<br>
<div class="suaza">
</div>

<br>

Building compromise and mutual understanding is incredibly important.
<br>
<br>

Sometimes we simply need to agree to disagree and recognise that there are different beliefs and forms of expression other than our own.
<br>
<br>


RULE #4: DO NOT FIGHT VIOLENCE WITH VIOLENCE 
Violence is never the answer.
<br>
<div class="muerda">
</div>
<br>


Peace can only be brought through free will, dialogue, empathy and forgiveness.
<br>
<br>

Do not stoop to same level as someone who is violent and therefore continue the vicious cycle.
<br>
<br>

This does not change anything
<br>


RULE #5: ACCEPT THAT IDENTITY IS FLUID 
Any one person can have multiple aspects to their identity.
<br>
<div class="mosca">
</div>
<br>

Identity comprises many elements such as nationality, cultural-linguistic origin, age and religious beliefs. Identity can and does change, taking on many new forms and means of personal expression as we learn new languages, move home, adopt new beliefs, marry into a different tradition and experience life! Do not put people into a box. Avoid categorising people according to and us vs.
<br>
<br>

them narrative and remember: we are all singular individuals with unique experiences.
<br>
<br>

Such approaches and narratives are highly divisive and unproductive.
<br>
<br>


RULE #6: AVOID STEREOTYPES 
<br>

Take people for the individuals they are. Avoid misconceptions, stereotypes and toxic narratives and get to know a person instead.
<br>
<div class="medellin">
</div>
<br>
This will avoid offence, misunderstandings and ultimately help you to create a real bond with others based on true understanding, empathy and trust.
<br>
<br>
After all, no one likes to be judged – especially from the outside
